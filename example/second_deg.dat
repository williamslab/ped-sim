# HALF-SIBLING
#
# generates 10 simulated pedigrees with two generations
# second generation has two branches
# with the branch parent specification of 1:1 and 2:1, individual b1-i1 from
# the first generation is a parent of both branches 1 and 2, but different
# spouses (with ids b1-s1 and b1-s2) are the parents of these two branches.
# Thus the printed individuals are half-siblings.

# DOUBLE COUSINS
#
# generates 10 simulated pedigrees with three generations
# first generation has two branches that are independent (new founders)
# second generation has four branches, with branches 1 and 2 full siblings with
# each other and branches 3 and 4 full siblings.
# with the branch specification of 1:1_3 and 2:2_4, individuals b1-i1 and b3-i1
# from generation 2 are the parents of b1-i1 in generation 3. Likewise,
# b2-i1 and b4-i1 from generation 2 are the parents of b2-i1 in generation 3.
# Thus the printed individuals are double cousins.
